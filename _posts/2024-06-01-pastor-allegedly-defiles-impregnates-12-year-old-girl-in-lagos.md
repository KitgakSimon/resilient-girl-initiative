This is disgusting, heartbreaking and sad at the same time. This society needs to be hard on [pedophiles](https://feminine.com.ng/2021/04/05/i-defiled-my-12-year-old-daughter-for-5-years-because-my-wife-is-no-longer-attractive/). Enough is enough about men raping and sexually abusing children and getting away with it.
