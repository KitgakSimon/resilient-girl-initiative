Joy Adeboye has emerged as a [2024 .ORG Global Impact Award](https://orgimpact.awardsplatform.com/) finalist. The prestigious award is an initiative of the Public Interest Registry organisation. The American company recognises individuals and organisations worldwide that are impacting their communities through its award.

Chosen from over 1,700 applicants in nearly 90 countries, Ms Adeboye was recognised in the Rising Star category of the prize for her transformative and exceptional work in advancing women’s and girls’ rights.

Ms Adeboye founded the [Resilient Girl Initiative](https://resilientgirlinitiative.org/about/), which addresses sexual and gender-based violence, ends period poverty, and provides self-esteem and leadership mentorship programmes for girls. She is also a student at Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State.

“My survivorship of being a rape and child labour victim at age 14  influenced my life in promoting gender equality. The tragedy took away the best part of my teenage life.” She told Naija Feminists Media, “I began my impact-making at age 15 because I needed to be a voice for other young girls like me who are facing all forms of injustice.”

The Resilient Girl Initiative has empowered over 20,000 women and girls in areas concerned with gender equality.

As one of the 35 global finalists for the 2024 .ORG Impact Awards, Ms Adeboye’s organisation, is eligible for a $10,000 to $50,000 donation. All finalists will receive an initial $2,500 donation and will also be invited to Washington, D.C., for a celebration, which will be well-attended by policy experts and other civil rights leaders. The final awards will be announced on October 8, 2024, in Washington, D.C.

“We started the .ORG Impact Awards to honour the organisations and people across the world who work tirelessly for their communities. This year’s group of finalists represent the very best of our community,” said Jon Nevett, President and CEO of Public Interest Registry.
