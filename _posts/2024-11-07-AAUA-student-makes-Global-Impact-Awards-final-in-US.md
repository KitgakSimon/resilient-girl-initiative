Joy Oluwatoyin Adeboye, a graduate of **Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko,** Ondo State, is  among top 35 finalists for the 2024 .ORG Global Impact Awards.

The star prize will be given to the  exceptional individual who has made a real impact on learning, the lives of their peers and on society.

The ORG Impact Awards is a global award  programme dedicated to recognising and celebrating outstanding individuals, and organisations around the world for their positive contributions to their sectors, communities and society at large.

The organisation behind the ORG domain, Public Interest Registry (PIR) has selected 35 finalists from over 1700 applications from more than 87 countries for the 6th annual ORG Impacts Awards across seven different categories.

Disclosing this on their X handle, the organisation said: “Joy Oluwatoyin Adeboye, founder of Resilient Girl Initiative, is a 2024 #OIA Rising Star finalist.”  Resilient Girl Initiative is a feminist-led .ORG supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and empowering girls and women.”

Also, the 22-year-old was the youngest among those selected. The ORG Award was recognised under the category of Rising Stars (Leaders under 25 years making a difference in their community and society) which she also serves as the only female under the category.

She said: “I feel overwhelmed after over 1,700 applicants across the world in nearly 90 countries, I must be sincere, I didn’t imagine it coming easy, though I was recognised for my transformative and exceptional work in advancing women and girls right especially on leadership and ending violence against women and girls in  Nigeria and Africa.

“ Surviving as a  rape and child labour victim at age 14  influenced  my life in promoting gender equality, this tragedy  took away the best part of my teenage life and attempting suicide out of mental health disorder.

“I began my impact making at age 15 because I needed to be a voice for other young girls like me who are facing all forms of injustices.

 “ I want my life to always inspire young girls like me, irrespective of the abuse, you can stand out to become a great lady, I also charge you to speak out to people who can help if you’re a victim.
